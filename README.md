### Brief Description and History

The object we chose is an air purifier designed by NS Nanotech and a startup with patented technology developed at the University of Michigan and McGill University. NS Nanotech is a company who used to produce nano-LED but when the pandemic decided to work with nitride semiconductors could help fight the virus. The collaboration between the two generated an innovative product: an air purifier designed to neutralize coronavirus in the user's personal airspace, that is about the size of a coffee mug. The object is designed for personal and business use in the home, office, schools, airplanes, ride-shares, and virtually anywhere else you can plug it in.

What we found interesting is the shape that reminds us of the Chinese xiangbao, a pocket that holds spices scenting the environment. We thought that is cool that Just as xiangbao allows you to scent the air and make it more pleasant, the air purifier also allows you to rid the air of the virus to make it safe for health.

### Technical Details

The model was built primarily using sweep and loft features in Fusion 360. Key challenges included:

1. Sweep path building - Created a sketch with guide lines due to single plane limitation

2. Section shape design - Optimized for wood insertion
![Section Shape](src/resource/Air%20Purifier/image%202.png)

3. Corner bending part design - Used sweep feature for perfect unfolding

### Resizeable Design

The entire object is parametrically designed with equations, allowing automatic adjustment and resizing without errors. This provides more flexibility for future use.

### Model Evolution
